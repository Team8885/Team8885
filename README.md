- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jim W Jones @Team8885 sponsored by Maeser Prepareatory Academy in Lindon Utah.  Team 8885 is affiliated with the FIRST organization.  FIRST => For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology.  See https;//firstinspires.org.  
- By Mar 7-9, Team 8885 built a Mechanum-drive robot and entered the Utah Regional Robot contest at the Maverik Center, in Salt Lake City. We competed against 40 teams, and won Best Rookie, entitling us to go to the National contest in Houston.
- FIRST was started by Woodie Flowers and Dean Kamen-- the latter is the creator of Seqway scooters and related products.  Mr. Kamen has used his talents and money for the last dozen or so years to encourage STEM amoung young people, from K-6, to middle school, and high school.
