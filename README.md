- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jim W Jones @Team8885 which is associated with FIRST high school robotics team competitions.
FIRST => For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology.  
- FIRST was started by Woodie Flowers and Dean Kamen-- the latter is the creator of Seqway scooters and related products.  Mr. Kamen has used his talents and money for the last dozen or so years to encourage STEM amoung young people, from K-6, to middle school,
and high school.  The team where I mentor the software side of robotics, Team 8885, is sponsored by Maeser Preparatory Academy, a 
charter public high school in Lindon, Utah.
